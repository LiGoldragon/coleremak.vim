**NOTE: This remapping can break the shortcuts of plugins including *emmet-vim*.**

Coleremak is a simple approach to the problem of using Vim with the
[Colemak][1] keyboard layout. It attempts to simply remap every modified
key to its physical equivalent on QWERTY, with the exception of
<kbd>O</kbd> being remapped to <kbd>P</kbd> (because on Colemak <kbd>;</kbd>
replaces <kbd>P</kbd>). Finally, in the spirit of Colemak, <kbd>:</kbd> and
<kbd>;</kbd> are swapped over.
